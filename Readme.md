"I immediately skipped to what I thought was the right design: multiple models for lists and list items, a bunch of different URLs for adding new lists and items, three new view functions, and about half a dozen new unit tests for all of the above. But I stopped myself. Although I was pretty sure I was smart enough to handle all those problems at once, the point of TDD is to allow you to do one thing at a time, when you need to. So I decided to be deliberately short-sighted, and at any given moment only do what was necessary to get the functional tests a little further."

Quote from Chapter 5 of "TDD with Python". 

Even the best, most beautifully written code can quickly become complex. TDD allows us to ensure that the code we add does not break our existing code, while enabling us to rapidly add in new features and functionality. Quality tests beget quality code. Simple and sweet.
